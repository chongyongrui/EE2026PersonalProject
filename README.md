# EE2026Project

This project was done as part of NUS's EE2026 Digital Design requirements.


## Personal Contributions:
1. I created a maze game that had 3 levels with increasing difficulty. I made use of clock speeds to vary the speed of the players movement through the maze. I also made use of a coordinate system to draw out the 
maze walls and objects with different color. I also implemeted a feature where users can first draw their map using a USB mouse that is connected to the Basys board, and then play the game. There is also an erase 
function for the user to make edits to the maze he draws.

2. Help to debug and combine all my team's code into the main menu and toggled to the different pages using different combinations of states of the switches on the Xylinx FPGA board.

## Team Contributions:
Together as a team, we managed to create a transmitter and receiver system that can read sounds waves through an external microphone that will decode the sound waves that are from Moorse code, and decodes it into 
letters that appear on the 7 - segment display on the board.
